= K3 Trivial Authorization

This gem works with the k3_authorization gem to provide an ultra-simple
authorization.  Basically, any logged-in user has FULL permissions for
everything, and any non-logged-in user has only guest permissions.  These
are not changeable.  There is no GUI for changing the default permissions 
provided by each gem.  If you want something more complex, use a different 
authorization provider gem.
